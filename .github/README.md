# MOON

## About

Moon is a programming language project designed to provide an intuitive and human-readable syntax.
The language is meant to be easily accessible to new programmers while offering flexibility and expressiveness for more experienced users.

Moon support indentation-based syntax, similar to languages like Python. This allows a clean and uncluttered code structure, emphasizing readability.

The project includes a lexer, a parser and an interpreter, to translate the Moon language into a form that can be executed or further analyzed. 

Moon's syntax includes standard programming constructs like variables, expressions, and control structures, as well as some unique elements tailored to the language's design goals.

Whether you're learning programming for the first time or looking for a fresh approach to coding, Moon aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for writing and understanding code.

Ready to explore the Moon language? Head straight to our [interactive Playground](https://moon.warn.group) and start coding without any setup !

Note: The language is still under development.
